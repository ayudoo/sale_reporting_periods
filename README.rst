Usage
-----

Go to the `Sales` app and open `Reporting` -> `Sales Periods`. Create you custom
periods with a start and end date, as well as complex conditions. New periods are
added in the beginning of the list and will be assigned to new sales orders, when the
conditions match.

You can also create custom generic periods like `Samples`, that you assign manually
to your orders.


Sales Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When reviewing your sales, `Reporting` -> `Sales`, you can now search and group by
your custom sales periods.


Update your existing Orders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After install or organizational changes, you may want to reset the sales periods on
your orders. You can do this in the `Sales` `Settings`, there scroll to the
`Quotations & Orders` section and execute ``Recompute Sales Periods on Sale Orders``.
